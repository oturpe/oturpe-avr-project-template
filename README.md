Template for oturpe style avr project.

## Usage

1. Copy *template* directory as root folder of the new project
2. Rename *.gitignore-template* as *.gitignore*. This step is necessary so that git source control for template itself does not interpret the file
3. Rename template strings with the project name (TODO: Which files?)
4. Configure avr model used by editing *avr-config* file

## Project structure

The project structure is explained in *README.md* in template directory.
